With the help of Pig Tool we analysis data direct using Pig Latin script

transactions = LOAD 'TransactionsData/part-m-00000' USING PigStorage(',')
 as (id:chararray,chain:chararray,dept:chararray,category:chararray,
   company:chararray,brand:chararray,date:chararray, productsize:float,
       productmeasure:chararray, purchasequantity:int, purchaseamount:float);

now we can see data
