          Partioning and bucketing
Partitioning and bucketing in hive will let you do faster querying.
For dynamic partitioning, load the data in to staging table which is already done.
Now create a production table, and insert data.

Now set the properties for the HIVE Partioning and bucketing
   set hive.enforce.bucketing= true;
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition= true;
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode= nonstrict;

Create production table and load data
create table transactions_production
(id string,
dept string,
category string,
company string,
date1 string,
productsize int,
productmeasure string,
purchasequantity int,
purchaseamount double)
partitioned by (chain string) clustered by (id) into 5 buckets row format delimited fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;

After creating table overwrite the data into table transactions_production:-
insert overwrite table transactions_production partition (chain)
select id,dept,category,company,brand,date1,productsize,productmeasure,purchasequantity,purchaseamount,chain
from transactions_staging;


   Now select Top 10 customers:-
select id,sum(purchaseamount) as custSpendings from  transactions_production group by id sort by custspending desc limit 10;

   Chain wise sales:-
select chain,sum(purchaseamount),sum(purchasequantity) from transactions_production group by chain;
 
   Top 10 brands:-
select brand,sum(purchaseamount) as custspendings from transcations_production group by brand sort by custspending desc limit 10;
 
  Top 10 companies:-
select company,sum(purchaseamount) as custspendings from transactions_production group by company sort by custspendings desc limit 10;
  
  Chain Year Monthly Sales:-
 select chain,split(date1,'/')[2] as year1,split(date1,'/')[0] as month1,sum(purchaseamount) as totalsales from transactions_production
 group by chain,split(date1,'/')[0],split(date1,'/')[2];
